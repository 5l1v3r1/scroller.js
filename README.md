# scroller.js

This will be a web API for creating custom scrolling views. It will support mouse scrolling, wheel scrolling, and touch scrolling.

# Dependencies

This uses [eventemitter.js](https://github.com/unixpickle/eventemitter.js).

This also requires window.requestAnimationFrame, so you must polyfill that if you wish to use this on older browsers.
